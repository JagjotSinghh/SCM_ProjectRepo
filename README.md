# Terax Team - Source Code Management

## Overview
This repository is managed by the Terax team, consisting of five members: Jagjot, Krish, Harmanjot, Khushi, and Harkamal. The purpose of this repository is to manage source code efficiently using version control.

## Getting Started
To get started with using this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone`.
2. Familiarize yourself with the project structure and conventions.
3. Install any dependencies required for development.
4. Create a new branch for your work using `git checkout -b <branch-name>`.
5. Start making changes or additions to the codebase.
6. Once your changes are complete, commit them using `git commit -m "Your commit message"`.
7. Push your changes to the repository using `git push origin <branch-name>`.
8. Create a pull request for your changes to be reviewed and merged into the main branch.

## Branching Strategy
We follow a branching strategy to manage our workflow efficiently. Here's an overview of our branching model:

- `main`: This branch represents the stable production-ready code.
- `develop`: This branch is used for ongoing development. All feature branches are merged into this branch.
- Feature branches: Each new feature or bug fix should have its own dedicated branch. These branches are created from `develop` and merged back into `develop` once completed.

## Code Review Process
Code review is an essential part of our development process to ensure code quality and maintainability. Here's our code review process:

1. Submit a pull request from your feature branch to `develop`.
2. Team members review the code, provide feedback, and suggest improvements.
3. Make necessary changes based on the feedback.
4. Once the code is approved, it can be merged into `develop`.

## Issue Tracking
We use GitHub issues to track bugs, feature requests, and other tasks. When starting work on an issue, assign it to yourself and move it to the appropriate project board.

## Coding Standards
Consistent coding standards are important for readability and maintainability. Please adhere to the following guidelines:

- Follow the language-specific style guide (e.g., PEP 8 for Python).
- Use meaningful variable and function names.
- Write clear and concise comments when necessary.
- Ensure proper indentation and formatting.
